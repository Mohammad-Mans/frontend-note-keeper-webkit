# My Note Keeper – Frontend

This is the **frontend part** of the [My Note Keeper](https://note-keeper-mo.vercel.app/) project — a full-stack note-taking app built with **React.js** and **MUI** on the frontend, and **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB** on the backend.

👉 **Backend repository**: [my-note-keeper-backend](https://github.com/Mohammad-Mans/my-note-keeper-backend)

---

## 📋 Features

- Add, edit, delete, and search notes
- Clean and responsive UI using **Material-UI**
- Seamless integration with a robust **RESTful API** backend

---

## 🚀 Live Demo

Frontend deployed on **Vercel**:  
🔗 [https://note-keeper-mo.vercel.app/](https://note-keeper-mo.vercel.app/)

> ⚠ **Note:**  
> The backend is hosted on **Renderer** (free tier), which spins down after inactivity.  
> Please be patient — the first request after a long idle time might take **up to 1–2 minutes** to respond while the server wakes up.
